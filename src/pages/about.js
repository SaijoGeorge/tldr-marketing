My name is Saijo George, I am an [SEO consultant from Melbourne](https://saijogeorge.com/) who spends a lot of time [building side projects](https://saijogeorge.com/projects.html) and reading up on what is changing up in the industry, I started giving talk on it at the [Melbourne SEO Meetups](https://www.meetup.com/Melbourne-SEO/) and decided to start a newsletter with that content and that is how tl;dr Marketing was born.

I work on a bunch of side projects, here are a few that you might enjoy. There is this one project which aims to collect all the [free images, video and other resources](https://allthefreestock.com/) you can use in your commercial or personal projects. Another one which gives you [UI inspirations](https://codemyui.com/) with code snippets so you can easily add them to you web projects. I also maintain a list of SEO tools that I try and keep updated with the top [SEO tools](https://saijogeorge.com/best-marketing-tools/) that I come across.
