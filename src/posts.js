  There are some very aggressive messages in there like:
  * The hotel costs more than similar hotels nearby.
  * Prices comparable at similar hotel nearby.


  And some favourable ones like:
  * The hotel is 20% less than usual.


  I image the last few weeks would have been quite stressful if you are an SEO working in the Hotel Industry with all these new changes.`,

After hitting $500 million in sales in 2017, Pinterest is on pace to almost double that this year by anonymous sources.
Pinterest is having particular success with mobile ads, as the site becomes a more popular place for big fashion and beauty brands to get in front of the company's 200 million monthly active users.
Reaching $1 billion in revenue will mark a significant milestone, but it's way below previous estimates. In 2015, [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/16/leaked-pinterest-documents-show-revenue-growth-forecasts/) reported on leaked financial documents that showed Pinterest was then projecting sales of $2.8 billion by 2018. It's a tall task to break up the digital advertising duopoly of Google and Facebook, which control a combined 57 percent of U.S. digital ad spending, according to [eMarketer](https://www.emarketer.com/content/google-and-facebook-s-digital-dominance-fading-as-rivals-share-grows). `,
